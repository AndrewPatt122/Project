            <h5>How do I appropriately credit the artist?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>A number of artists have their own personal websites which state how to credit their work correctly and these will be linked in the video description. For artists that do not have their own website, a section in the video will be available for you to copy and paste into your own content, which credits them correctly.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>Some of the music tracks on our YT-channel are free to use for commercial use, but with most of the tracks you’ll have to buy a license from the artist. In order to know if a track is free to use for commercial use, you will have to check the description of the video or contact the artist directly.</p>

            <h5>I got a copyright claim on my video, what do I do?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>First you need to figure out the reason why you got a copyright claim on your video. Make sure you have credited the artist correctly – we have explained how to correctly credit the artist in a question above.

Sometimes an error may happen where a copyright claims occurs and if you have credited the music correctly, you can dispute to claim to resolve the issue.</p>
